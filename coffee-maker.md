This is another great and simple time killer that was also designed in that retro 8 bit style that so appeals to old people like myself.

This is a keyboard only game and it starts out easy, but after a while, things speed up and you only get three mistakes before it’s GAME OVER!

Your right, left, up and down arrows are how you add ingredients to your coffee drinks.

You have Expresso (sic), Hot Water, Hot Milk, Sugar, Chantilly, Cacao, Cream and Whiskey.

Adding different amounts of these ingredients will produce a number or different types of drinks.

For example, 1x expresso + 2x hot water will create a “Long Coffee.”

So you would press the up arrow once, then the right arrow twice to successfully make the drink.

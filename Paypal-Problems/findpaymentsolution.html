<h2>If You Are Reading This Right Now, Chances Are...</h2>
<h1>Your Paypal Account Has Been Permanently Limited</h1>
<h2>And You Need Help Creating a New Account!</h2>


<p>
Paypal has all sorts of bogus reasons for limiting accounts, so don&#8217;t be surprised if they screw you over and hold all of your money for up to 180 days. That&#8217;s right, they will refuse to release your funds for 180 days!</p>
<p>How does a business get away with doing that to its customers? You probably can&#8217;t imagine your money being held hostage by the bank you trust, right?</p>
Well, unfortunately&#8230;Paypal is not a banking institution. In addition to this, you agreed to their terms of service when you signed up for your account.</div>
<p>And keep in mind that since Paypal is about as shifty as a legal business could possibly get, they are sure to cover their tracks in terms of their TOS and all other policies that you agree to upon signing up for an account.</p>
<p>Why does this matter so much, anyway? If you received horrible customer service at a restaurant, you would probably just never go to eat there again, right? You&#8217;d find a better place and eat there instead.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because there are tons of restaurants to choose from. This isn&#8217;t the case for payment processors, at least ones that offer similar functionality to what Paypal currently does.</p>
Sure, there are a few alternatives. None of them are viable as replacements for Paypal, unfortunately.</div>
<p>Paypal has another unfair advantage since it is the most trusted and by far the most widely used payment service online, which means buyers have confidence when using the service to send and receive payments.</p>
<p>You could always say forget Paypal and just go for a merchant account. If you own a successful online business, going that route makes a good amount of sense.</p>
<p>However, if you are an independent contractor or freelancer and you just need a method of getting paid on a per project basis, then a merchant account will not make much sense for you.</p>
Merchant accounts work great for e-commerce sites that sell physical goods that are shipped to buyers. Not so much for internet marketers who sell digital products or run small operations.</div>
<p>So what, then, are we left to do? Sit in the corner and cry about being the only kid left out of the Paypal club? I think not.</p>
<p>I say beat them at their own game! Outsmart them. And start making money again. Complete one of the following offers (all three of which of which will help you with Paypal) to receive my Paypal Limited Account Fix eBook 100% free! Either way, let&#8217;s get you back in business!</p>

<p>The greatest thing about these cards is that you can use them as a freelancer to accept payment from anyone in the world, and they can pay you with a credit card OR a bank account.</p>
<p>While you can&#8217;t sign up for a card directly through Payoneer, you can get one by either signing up for a site like ODesk and then applying for one, OR you can click this link to apply for one right now. Signing up through my link will get you a free $25 bonus gift after you&#8217;ve funded your card with the first $100.</p>

<ul>
<li>Accept payments from anyone worldwide</li>
<li>Card can receive funds from your client&#8217;s credit card OR bank account</li>

<h2>Need to Verify Your Paypal Account?</h2>
<h1>Here's How to do it With Your Netspend Card </h1>
<h2>Follow These Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>


<h3>Apply for Your Netspend Card</h3>

<ul>
<li>You are pre-approved for the card, there is no credit check!</li>
<li>Setup direct deposit and get your paycheck 2 days early</li>
<li>Wait for your card to arrive in the mail within about 5 business days</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Activate Your Card</h3>
<p>You can do this by phone or online. Create an online account to manage your card after it has been activated.</p>

<h3>Change Your Billing Address</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Login to your Netspend online account and and go to edit profile, where you will change your billing address to the one you used for Paypal. Remember this <strong>must</strong> be an address not associated with your previously limited account.</p>

<h3>Create Virtual Accounts</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Once you have your Netspend card and it&#8217;s been activated, you can log into your account and create virtual accounts which will generate a new card number with expiration date and three digit security codes which you can use to make purchases through Paypal safely.</p>
<p>Just be sure you choose the option that says you <strong>DO NOT</strong> have a Paypal account when checking out, then enter your virtual account info and say no thanks when they ask if you want to sign up for Paypal.</p>

 <h2>100% Working Solution for Paypal</h2> 
 <h1>Keep Accepting Payments Sent to Gmail Address</h1> 
 <h2>Even After Being Permanently Limited!</h2>
 
 
 <p>Did you know that you can continue to accept payments using an email address you used for Paypal, even if the account is permanently limited?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true. I know because I&#8217;ve done it myself and just tested it again right before writing this to make sure it&#8217;s still working.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works. Let&#8217;s say that the gmail address you used for your limited Paypal account was <strong>yourlimitedaccount@gmail.com</strong>.</p>
<p>After you follow the steps outlined in <a title="">my free eBook</a>, you should be able to successfully setup a new working Paypal account.</p>
<p>Once you have your new account created and verified, then all you have to do is login to it and click on profile from the menu bar, then choose the option to edit your email addresses.</p>
<p>Add dots between the each word or letter of your old gmail address</p></div>
<p>When you&#8217;re on the next screen, you will click on the add button and you should end up on a page that looks like the image to the right of this text.</p>
<p>When you type in your old Gmail address from the limited Paypal account, simply add dots between each word or each letter and then click on the save button.</p>
<p>Next you will receive a confirmation email in your Gmail inbox. Pretty funny, considering they sent a notice of permanent limitation to the same email address when they banned you for life. I snickered at that more than a little bit.</p>
<p>Anyhow, go ahead and click on the confirmation link and enter your Paypal password when prompted. You should be good to go and can now receive payments with your old Gmail address.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, Paypal does not recognize the variation as the same email address. Even though it is.</p>

       <p>
Paypal has all sorts of bogus reasons for limiting accounts, so don&#8217;t be surprised if they screw you over and hold all of your money for up to 180 days. That&#8217;s right, they will refuse to release your funds for 180 days!</p>
<p>How does a business get away with doing that to its customers? You probably can&#8217;t imagine your money being held hostage by the bank you trust, right?</p>
Well, unfortunately&#8230;Paypal is not a banking institution. In addition to this, you agreed to their terms of service when you signed up for your account.</p>
<p>And keep in mind that since Paypal is about as shifty as a legal business could possibly get, they are sure to cover their tracks in terms of their TOS and all other policies that you agree to upon signing up for an account.</p>
<p>Why does this matter so much, anyway? If you received horrible customer service at a restaurant, you would probably just never go to eat there again, right? You&#8217;d find a better place and eat there instead.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because there are tons of restaurants to choose from. This isn&#8217;t the case for payment processors, at least ones that offer similar functionality to what Paypal currently does.</p>
<p>Sure, there are a few alternatives. None of them are viable as replacements for Paypal, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Paypal has another unfair advantage since it is the most trusted and by far the most widely used payment service online, which means buyers have confidence when using the service to send and receive payments.</p>
<p>You could always say forget Paypal and just go for a merchant account. If you own a successful online business, going that route makes a good amount of sense.</p>
<p>However, if you are an independent contractor or freelancer and you just need a method of getting paid on a per project basis, then a merchant account will not make much sense for you.</p>
<p>Merchant accounts work great for e-commerce sites that sell physical goods that are shipped to buyers. Not so much for internet marketers who sell digital products or run small operations.</p>
<p>So what, then, are we left to do? Sit in the corner and cry about being the only kid left out of the Paypal club? I think not.</p>
<p>I say beat them at their own game! Outsmart them. And start making money again. Complete one of the following offers (all three of which of which will help you with Paypal) to receive my Paypal Limited Account Fix eBook 100% free! Either way, let&#8217;s get you back in business!</p></div>

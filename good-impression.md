This was [one of the very first games](https://ellian.itch.io/good-impression) I played on itch.io.

In fact, it was this short little game that managed to spark my interest in browsing more of the content available on the site.

I come back to it every so often to try and top my current high score (I have managed to put all items in the appropriate places, *BUT* I always end up with a single can of soda on the floor to the right of the couch that I *cannot* for the life of me figure out what to do with it!)

Anyhow, the game is very short and simple: your house is in a disastrous state and your mother just called and wants to stop by. 

The catch?

You have only *three minutes* until she arrives.

Panic mode engaged!

Quickly wash all the dirty dishes scattered about the room, clean the stains off the floor, get all the trash lying about into a garbage can, put leftovers in the fridge, hide your dirty magazines, get dirty laundry into the right receptacles and put your clean ones away, QUICKLY!

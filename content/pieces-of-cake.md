Okay, first a disclaimer: I’m a *huge* fan of retro pixel art game design. It’s true!

I grew up in the nineties and my first gaming console was the Super Nintendo when I was about seven or eight years old.

I started out playing Tetris and Donkey Kong on one of those kids, so don’t roll your eyes too hard at me for being a nostalgic sap when it comes to 8 bit pixel art LOL.

That having been revealed, it will come as no surprise that I’m a *complete* sucker for the aesthetics and design of this game!

Another concept that at first may seem overly simple, but you will be surprised at how long you can keep it going and how crazy you might be able to score for a single cake.

For each level, you need to make a cake that contains the right number of whichever ingredient you are instructed to include.

You place the ingredient cards in the oven together, but the placement is crucially important.

You will notice that many or most of the cards also have little knobs on one or two of their edges, either red, green, dark brown, yellow or white.

Each card/ingredient also has a color of its own, also one of the aforementioned.

Placing two of the same ingredients next to or above/below each other causes them to combine and become one, the number in the lower right hand corner of each card will combine and increase as well.

The idea is to try your best to place them next to different ingredients which correspond to the colored knobs on the square’s edges. This will cause them to switch places with the other ingredient and your score will increase, 
depending on the combination you make.

This is super addicting and fun,  [give it a try!](https://krajzeg.itch.io/pieces-of-cake)

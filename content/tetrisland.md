Other than [this game](https://janistch.itch.io/tetrisland) involving the fitting together of different shapes, that seems to be where any familiarity with Tetris ends.

Each level you are given a new “island” which acts as a container to organize your different shapes within.

Unlike in Tetris, you cannot rotate any of the shapes.

The first ten levels are easy to breeze through, since your islands are mostly empty.

However, as you progress, more trees start to pop up which act as barriers to your shapes. 

If you get stuck, you have two options: you can use some of your in-game earnings to shuffle your pieces (a must) or you can use the much more expensive option of removing one of the trees in order to place one of your shapes.

Playing this actually reminds me more of a game called Puzzle Express, which was published by GameHouse many years ago.

I loved Puzzle Express too and this game brought on a lot of nostalgia from the hours I spent playing that so long ago.

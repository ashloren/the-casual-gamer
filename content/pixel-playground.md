I feel like this is almost more of a fun interactive toy than it is a *game* per se, which is totally fine by me.

As we’ve established by now, I’m naturally drawn to games which use 8bit or 16bit pixel art.

My Pixel Playground is a fun little game in which you can design your own little park.

The sandbox mode lets you just play around with all the available assets in the game, whereas the campaign mode has specific tasks to complete and other assets are unlocked upon success.

There are a few different categories of assets you can choose to add to your park, such as landscaping items and playground equipment.

Landscaping includes assets like trees, stepping stones, flowers, shrubs, garbage cans, park benches, etc.

Playground equipment includes items such as slides, swing sets, and much more.
